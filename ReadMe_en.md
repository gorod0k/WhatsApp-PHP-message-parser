WhatsApp (like other services, like Youtube - revanced Youtube) blocks modified applications (like YoWhatsApp ).
This was the reason for abandoning it, and the desire to keep chat history as part of my personal life was the reason for writing a parser for the SQLite message database msgstore.db. The database schema is constantly changing, so I have at least 2 versions of the msgstore.db database with different table organization schemes.
